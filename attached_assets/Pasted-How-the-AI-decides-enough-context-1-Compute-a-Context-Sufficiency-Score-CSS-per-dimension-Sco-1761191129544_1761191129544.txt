How the AI decides “enough context”

1) Compute a Context Sufficiency Score (CSS) per dimension

Score = weighted blend of 5 signals. Normalize everything to 0–1.
	•	Length & Coverage (w=0.20)
Tokens/words + # of required fields mentioned for that dimension. (Short ≠ bad, but usually correlates.)
	•	Specificity (w=0.25)
Presence of concrete details: numbers, dates, places, names, durations, measurable outcomes, constraints.
	•	Sensory/Emotional Richness (w=0.20)
Sensory lexicon hit-rate (see/hear/feel/smell/taste/body sensations), emotion words, intensity adjectives.
	•	Actionability/Identity Clarity (w=0.20)
Verbs that imply behaviors/rituals; “I am” / archetypal traits; future orientation (“I will”, “by Q2”, etc.).
	•	Coherence/Confidence (w=0.15)
Low vagueness (“soon”, “more”, “better”), fewer hedges (“maybe”, “kinda”), consistent tense, few contradictions.

Final CSS ∈ [0,1] = 0.20Len + 0.25Spec + 0.20Rich + 0.20Act/ID + 0.15*Coh

Decision bands
	•	CSS ≥ 0.70 → Advance (move to next dimension)
	•	0.40 ≤ CSS < 0.70 → Clarify (ask 1 tailored follow-up to deepen weakest signal)
	•	CSS < 0.40 → Evoke (ask 1 evocative prompt + 1 specificity prompt, max 2 turns before reframing)

2) Dimension-specific “coverage checks”

Each dimension has 3–5 “slots.” Hit-rate boosts the Length & Coverage subscore and gates advancement.

Vision (need ≥3/5)
	•	Specific goal/outcome
	•	Scene/location/timeframe
	•	Who’s involved
	•	Sensory details (sights/sounds/feel)
	•	Success criteria/metrics

Emotion (need ≥2/4)
	•	Named emotions (≥2)
	•	Body sensations (where/how it feels)
	•	Desired frequency words (e.g., freedom/power/peace)
	•	Peak-memory anchor that matches the feeling

Belief (need ≥2/3)
	•	Limiting belief named
	•	Replacement/empowering belief
	•	Evidence or reframe language (why it’s true/possible)

Identity (need ≥2/4)
	•	“I am” traits/archetype
	•	Daily behaviors/habits/posture/energy
	•	How others experience them
	•	Tone/energetic signature

Embodiment & Action (need ≥3/5)
	•	Daily/weekly rituals
	•	Near-term actions (next 24–72h)
	•	“Act as if” example
	•	Signs/synchronicities to watch
	•	Surrender/trust description

3) What the AI asks next (based on weakest signal)

Identify the lowest subscore among the 5 signals and the missing coverage slots. Generate exactly one tailored follow-up (or two if in Evoke band).
	•	If Specificity low → ask for numbers, names, timelines, locations.
	•	If Richness low → ask for sensory/body/emotion.
	•	If Action/ID low → ask for 1 habit or 1 “I am” trait in practice.
	•	If Coherence low → tighten or resolve contradictions (“Which of these two matters more?”).
	•	If Coverage low → target the missing slot(s) from the dimension checklist.

4) Threshold tuning (defaults you can ship now)
	•	Token floor per answer: ≥50 tokens gets full Length credit; linear scale from 0–50.
	•	Specificity cues: count of numerals, dates, named entities, place names, units (%, $, min, miles), proper nouns.
	•	Richness cues: hits from sensory + emotion lexicons (keep small curated lists you can expand).
	•	Action/ID cues: imperative/future verbs, schedule words (daily, morning, Mon/Wed), “I am” statements, archetype words.
	•	Coherence cues: hedge/ambiguity/contradiction detectors; penalize if >2 hedges or conflicting goals appear.
