My Visions — Concept Overview (by Outcome)

The “Living Vision” tab will become “My Visions”.   With this update, the key organizing container will be individual visions (like goals or outcomes), not categories (health, wealth, relationships, play, etc…) 
Each card represents a specific dream or outcome (e.g., “Dream Partnership,” “Financial Freedom,” “Peak Health”).
 Main Screen: “My Visions”
* Shows all created visions as cards.
* Each card has title, last update date, and category stamp (health, wealth, relationship, etc…)
* Search, filter, and sort options for easy navigation.
* “+ New Vision” button starts the evocation flow.
* Empty state invites the user to start their first vision.
 Vision Detail Screen
* Displays the vision summary, tagline, and progress across stages.
* Shows all previous question–answer turns from the evocation flow.
* Lists meditations generated from that vision.
* Actions include Continue Flow, Edit, Create Meditation, Share, Delete
 Vision Evocation Flow
Start with a grounding screen then introduce prompts that guide the user through five stages: Vision → Belief → Identity → Embodiment → Action  Grounding:
Goal: Create a distinct opening into the experience that encourages a contemplative state for the user. 
* The MVP of this looks like just a single screen with this text, and a button that says “let’s begin”

Text:  
“Breathe in.
Arrive here.
The world slows.
Your vision awaits.”
 For the prompt flow, each step can get 1 or 2 questions. The questions should use AI to create relevant questions based on the users previous responses. 
Vision:  Goal: Help the user see, feel, and articulate a high, soul-aligned outcome.
Prompt Focus:
* Start with a broad question that invites the user to share what they want to create in the world.
* Invite imagination, emotion, and sensory detail.
* Encourage them to describe what their ideal reality looks, feels, and sounds like.
* Use language that lifts them beyond current constraints into pure possibility.

Belief: 
Goal: Surface the beliefs, fears, and subconscious stories that shape or limit their reality.
Prompt Focus:
* Ask questions that expose assumptions, patterns, or inner dialogue.
* Normalize resistance and invite compassionate honesty.
* Transition from awareness to empowerment (ie what new beliefs would better serve them?)

Identity
Goal: Anchor into who they must become to live that vision effortlessly.
Prompt Focus:
* Help them connect to the emotional, behavioral, and energetic qualities of that self.
* Guide them to describe how this version thinks, decides, and acts.
* Encourage identification with that state as already true.

Embodiment 
Goal: Bring the future self into the present moment — emotionally and somatically.
Prompt Focus:
* Invite them to feel, visualize, or sense the energy of that future self now.
* Anchor new beliefs into the body through visualization, breath, or sensory awareness.
* Reinforce that transformation happens through state repetition, not distant striving.

Action
Goal: Channel clarity and embodiment into tangible movement.
Prompt Focus:
* Help them define aligned, exciting actions that bring their vision into form.
* Encourage simplicity, consistency, and momentum.
* Reinforce that aligned action is the natural expression of identity.

After the “Action” step, we can invite the user to generate a meditation (present them the customize meditation screen)

Notes
* Let’s clean up/get rid of any of the logic and system prompts from the previous structure that won’t be used in this flow. 
* Let’s use the existing vision prompt screen UI with the mic button/text input, etc…
