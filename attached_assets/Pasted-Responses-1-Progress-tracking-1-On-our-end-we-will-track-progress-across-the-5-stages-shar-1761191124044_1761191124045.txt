1. Progress & tracking
    1. On our end, we will track progress across the 5 stages shared in the updated workflow (Vision, Emotion, Belief, Identity,  Embodiment/Action). We will use this to inform & guide the vision prompts we create for the user, BUT
    2. Let’s keep progress more fluid and invisible to the user. We can show a vague progress bar that progresses towards 100% to the user, but we don’t need to show them the quantified progression (5/5) or the names of the steps.
2. If all 5 categories have enough context, we allow the user to continue adding depth. This can effectively evolve the vision over time (ie if my vision for my wealth grows from a $10M portfolio to a $20M portfolio). In this case, when new context is introduced that conflicts with older context, we update the vision to the newest context shared. 
3. How do we determine “enough context” see the attached paste “How the AI decides “enough context”
4. Yes, a user can jump categories if their answer crosses multiple domains. We don’t have to stay rigidly to the flow - we can jump around if it feels in the flow of the conversation.
5. Yes, when generating variations of questions, reference specific details the user mentions. Let’s see what it looks like to allow multi-part structure of questions for now (if it’s too much, we can repeal back to one focused question per prompt). 
6. Let’s stick with the simple starters for now. I’m going to update this, but let’s get to that after this update. 
7. Let’s have the title automatically generated after the first flow (series of responses) and stay consistent afterwards. Let’s have the tagline and summary auto-generate after the first flow, and regenerate after subsequent flows. 
8. Yes, let’s rename it to context_depth, and lets track each categories completeness within each vision separately. 
9. When a user taps “Continue Flow” on an existing vision, the AI should analyze all responses and decide which category needs more depth. 
10. Keep category names invisible to the user.
